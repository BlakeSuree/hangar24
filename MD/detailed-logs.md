## 2025-01-27 [Current Time] – Wave-like Hover Effect Implementation

Question Asked:
User wanted the hover effect on the Spitfire art plane to create a wave-like effect that diminishes with distance from the cursor, rather than having the same effect for every character.

Response / Action Taken:
- Replaced uniform glow effect with distance-based wave effect
- Created 4 different glow classes (glow, glow-1, glow-2, glow-3) with diminishing intensity
- Updated JavaScript to calculate distance from cursor and apply appropriate glow class
- Set maximum distance of 8 pixels for the wave effect
- Each glow level has different opacity, scale, and text-shadow values

Additional Context:
- Wave effect creates a more natural, organic hover interaction
- Closest characters get strongest glow (glow class)
- Farther characters get progressively weaker effects (glow-1, glow-2, glow-3)
- Effect creates a ripple-like visual response to mouse movement
- Maintains smooth transitions and responsive feel

## 2025-01-27 [Current Time] – Compression Effect Implementation

Question Asked:
User found the wave-like hover effect unsatisfactory and wanted to replace it with a compression effect where sections compress when hovering over them.

Response / Action Taken:
- Removed all wave-like glow effects and related CSS classes
- Implemented simple compression effect using scale(0.85) transform
- Updated JavaScript to apply compression to characters within 12px of cursor
- Added smooth transition with ease-out timing for natural feel
- Simplified the interaction to focus on compression rather than glow

Additional Context:
- Compression effect creates a "pressing down" visual feedback
- Characters scale down to 85% when hovered
- Effect radius set to 12 pixels for good coverage
- Smooth 0.15s transition provides responsive feel
- Much simpler and more direct interaction than previous wave effect

## 2025-01-27 15:45 UTC – Wing Structure Update

Question Asked:
User wanted to add more structure to the wings of the Spitfire plane in the ASCII art.

Response / Action Taken:
- Enhanced wing structure by adding more detailed lines and patterns
- Added wing tips and additional wing details
- Improved overall plane structure while maintaining ASCII art aesthetic
- Maintained clickable functionality for the plane

Additional Context:
- Wings now have more realistic structure
- Plane looks more detailed and recognizable
- All interactive features preserved
- ASCII art style maintained

## 2025-01-27 16:30 UTC – EREBOR Clickable Implementation

Question Asked:
User wanted to make "EREBOR" text in the ASCII art plane clickable, noting it appears vertically.

Response / Action Taken:
- Implemented JavaScript to make EREBOR letters clickable
- Created function to replace specific characters with clickable links
- Positioned clickable letters at character position 20, lines 8-13
- Added click handler function with alert functionality
- User manually fixed positioning by removing original text and adjusting character positions

Additional Context:
- EREBOR appears vertically in the plane design
- Each letter is individually clickable
- User resolved positioning issues by adjusting character coordinates
- Final solution: character position 20, lines 8-13 for proper placement
- Click functionality works with alert("EREBOR clicked!")

## 2025-01-27 17:15 UTC – EREBOR Clickable Issue Resolution

Question Asked:
User reported seeing duplicate EREBOR text and "undefined" errors when testing the clickable functionality.

Response / Action Taken:
- Attempted multiple approaches to fix duplication issue
- Initially tried click detection method which caused "undefined" errors
- Reverted to original link-based approach
- User manually resolved by removing original EREBOR text from ASCII art
- Updated character positions from 25 to 20 for correct placement

Additional Context:
- Issue was caused by having both original text and JavaScript-generated clickable text
- User's solution: remove original text, use JavaScript-generated text only
- Character position adjustment from 25 to 20 fixed positioning
- Final working solution: clean single EREBOR text that's clickable
- All functionality now working correctly without duplication or errors

## 2025-01-27 15:45 UTC – Feature Addition

Question Asked:
"ok now let me click erebor which will take me to erebor.com"

Response / Action Taken:
Made the "Erebor" title in erebor.html clickable by wrapping it in an anchor tag that links to https://erebor.com with target="_blank" to open in a new tab. Maintained the existing styling with semi-transparent white color and no text decoration.

Additional Context:
The user had previously made styling changes to erebor.html including adjusting colors and adding an "about" section. The erebor.html page now displays company information about Erebor as a national bank with founder details, and the title is now clickable to the actual erebor.com website.

## 2025-01-27 15:50 UTC – Layout Adjustment

Question Asked:
"for the 'about' section how do i make it so its 2 lines instead of 1"

Response / Action Taken:
Added `max-width: 400px` and `line-height: 1.4` to the `.about` CSS class to force the long text to wrap to 2 lines with proper spacing. This creates a more readable layout for the about section text.

Additional Context:
The user had previously adjusted the positioning of the content (top: 33%) and fixed the margin for the about section. The about text "A new kind of national bank, designed specifically to serve the next generation of high-growth companies." was displaying as one long line and now wraps to 2 lines for better readability. 

## 2025-01-27 15:55 UTC – Layout Adjustment

Question Asked:
"Ok now we need to center the about cection"

Response / Action Taken:
Added `text-align: center` to the `.about` CSS class to center the about section text within its container.

Additional Context:
The about section was previously set to display on 2 lines with max-width and line-height, but the text was left-aligned. Now it's properly centered within its 400px max-width container. 

## 2025-01-27 16:00 UTC – Layout Fix

Question Asked:
"its not centered"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed `margin: 0.5rem` to `margin: 0.5rem auto` in the `.about` CSS class to properly center the about section horizontally. The `auto` margins on left and right will center the element within its container.

Additional Context:
The about section had `text-align: center` but the margin wasn't centered, causing the element itself to be off-center. Now both the element and its text content are properly centered. 

## 2025-01-27 16:05 UTC – Typography Update

Question Asked:
"can we use Space Grotesk font and see what that looks like"

Response / Action Taken:
Updated the font from Lato to Space Grotesk throughout the page. Added Google Fonts import for Space Grotesk with weights 300, 400, and 500, and updated all font-family declarations in body, title, founders, about, and cta-btn classes.

Additional Context:
Space Grotesk is a modern geometric sans-serif font that should give the page a more contemporary, tech-forward appearance. The font change affects all text elements including the title, about section, and founders information. 

## 2025-01-27 16:10 UTC – Responsive Layout Implementation

Question Asked:
"can we contanarize both the text and the plane? so that when the screen gets smaller the text doesnt extend over the plane"

Response / Action Taken:
Created a new `content-plane-container` that wraps both the ASCII art and text content using flexbox layout. Added responsive scaling with mobile-specific adjustments: container uses 95vw/85vh on mobile, text sizes scale down proportionally (title: 1.5rem, about: 0.9rem, founders: 0.8rem), and about section max-width reduces to 300px.

Additional Context:
The user had previously adjusted the content positioning to top: 25%. The new containerized approach ensures the text and plane maintain their spatial relationship and scale together, preventing text overflow on smaller screens while preserving the design integrity. 

## 2025-01-27 16:15 UTC – Layout Fix

Question Asked:
"that made it so the text is also centered over the plane"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the content positioning from `top: 0` to `top: -20%` to move the text above the plane instead of being centered over it. This maintains the original layout intention while keeping the containerized responsive behavior.

Additional Context:
The containerized approach had positioned the text at the top of the container (top: 0), which centered it over the plane. The negative top value moves the text up above the plane while preserving the responsive scaling benefits. 

## 2025-01-27 16:20 UTC – Mobile Layout Fix

Question Asked:
"ok better but for a phone the plane isnt shifting lower"

Response / Action Taken:
Added mobile-specific adjustments in the media query: `margin-top: 15vh` on the content-plane-container to push the entire container down on mobile, and `top: -50%` on the content to adjust text positioning for smaller screens.

Additional Context:
The user had manually adjusted the text positioning to top: -70% for desktop. The mobile adjustments ensure the plane shifts lower on phones while maintaining appropriate text positioning for the smaller screen size. 

## 2025-01-27 16:25 UTC – Mobile Text Positioning Fix

Question Asked:
"the text also shifted lower now. the text should never overlap with the plane"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the mobile text positioning from `top: -50%` to `top: -120%` to move the text much higher above the plane on mobile devices, ensuring there's no overlap between the text and the plane.

Additional Context:
The previous mobile adjustment had moved both text and plane down together. The new positioning ensures the text stays well above the plane on mobile screens while the plane remains in its adjusted position. 

## 2025-01-27 16:30 UTC – Layout Adjustment

Question Asked:
"ok perfect! now lets make the about text 2 lines instead of 3"

Response / Action Taken:
Increased the max-width of the about section from 400px to 500px for desktop and from 300px to 350px for mobile to allow more text per line, reducing the about section from 3 lines to 2 lines while maintaining good readability.

Additional Context:
The about section was previously displaying on 3 lines due to the narrower max-width. The increased width allows the text "A new kind of national bank, designed specifically to serve the next generation of high-growth companies." to wrap more naturally to 2 lines. 

## 2025-01-27 16:35 UTC – Layout Repositioning

Question Asked:
"Also I want to see the 'created by' below the plane."

Response / Action Taken:
Added absolute positioning to the `.founders` class with `bottom: -20%` for desktop and `bottom: -15%` for mobile to position the "Created By" text below the plane. Added centering with `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`.

Additional Context:
The "Created By" text was previously positioned above the plane with the title and about text. Now it appears below the plane, creating a balanced layout with content above and below the plane. 

## 2025-01-27 16:40 UTC – Layout Fix

Question Asked:
"it didnt go lower than the plane, it went into the 'about' text"

Response / Action Taken:
Adjusted the "Created By" text positioning from `bottom: -20%` to `bottom: -80%` for desktop and from `bottom: -15%` to `bottom: -60%` for mobile to position it well below the plane and away from the about text, preventing overlap.

Additional Context:
The initial positioning was too close to the about text, causing overlap. The much lower positioning ensures the "Created By" text appears below the plane without interfering with other content. 

## 2025-01-27 16:45 UTC – Structural Layout Fix

Question Asked:
"its still above the plane"

Response / Action Taken:
Moved the "Created By" text outside the content div and made it a direct child of the content-plane-container. Updated positioning to `bottom: -10%` for desktop and `bottom: -5%` for mobile. This positions it relative to the plane container instead of the content container.

Additional Context:
The founders text was previously inside the absolutely positioned content div, causing it to be positioned relative to the content container (above the plane). Moving it outside allows it to be positioned relative to the plane container, enabling it to appear below the plane.

## 2025-01-27 16:50 UTC – Final Positioning Adjustment

Question Asked:
"its now below the plane but still overlapping with the very bottom"

Response / Action Taken:
Adjusted the founders text positioning from `bottom: -10%` to `bottom: -25%` for desktop and from `bottom: -5%` to `bottom: -20%` for mobile to provide more clearance between the bottom of the plane and the "Created By" text.

Additional Context:
The founders text was positioned below the plane but still overlapping with the bottom edge. The increased negative bottom values provide sufficient spacing to prevent any overlap while maintaining the desired layout.

## 2025-01-27 16:55 UTC – Layout Restructuring

Question Asked:
"lets put everything under the plane"

Response / Action Taken:
Moved all text content (title, about, and founders) below the plane by changing content positioning from `top: -40%` to `bottom: -40%` for desktop and from `top: -120%` to `bottom: -30%` for mobile. Simplified founders styling by removing absolute positioning and moved it back into the content div.

Additional Context:
The user had previously adjusted the content positioning to top: -40%. Now all text content appears below the plane in a clean, stacked layout with the plane at the top and all information below it.

## 2025-01-27 17:00 UTC – Overlap Fix

Question Asked:
"i think better but the erebor title is still overlapping with the plane"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the content positioning from `bottom: -40%` to `bottom: -80%` for desktop to move all text content (including the Erebor title) much further down below the plane, preventing any overlap.

Additional Context:
The user had previously adjusted the mobile positioning to bottom: -70%. The increased negative bottom value for desktop ensures the Erebor title and all other text content have sufficient clearance from the plane.

## 2025-01-27 17:05 UTC – Layout Adjustment

Question Asked:
"lets make created by one line instead of 2"

Response / Action Taken:
Added `max-width: 600px` for desktop and `max-width: 400px` for mobile to the founders text CSS to allow the "Created By" text to display on one line instead of wrapping to two lines.

Additional Context:
The founders text "Created By: Palmer Luckey, Trevor Capozza, Jacob Hirshman, Owen Rapaport, Aaron Pelz" was previously wrapping to two lines. The increased max-width allows all founder names to fit on a single line while maintaining readability.

## 2025-01-27 17:10 UTC – Layout Fix

Question Asked:
"its still 2 lines"

Response / Action Taken:
Increased the founders text max-width from 600px to 800px for desktop and from 400px to 500px for mobile to provide more space for the "Created By" text to display on one line without wrapping.

Additional Context:
The previous max-width values were insufficient to accommodate all founder names on a single line. The increased width should prevent the text from wrapping to two lines.

## 2025-01-27 17:15 UTC – Layout Centering

Question Asked:
"there we go. now need it centered"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the founders text margin from `margin: 0` to `margin: 0 auto` to center the "Created By" text horizontally while maintaining the single-line display with `white-space: nowrap`.

Additional Context:
The founders text was successfully forced to display on one line using `white-space: nowrap`. The `margin: 0 auto` centers the element horizontally while `text-align: center` centers the text content within the element.

## 2025-01-27 17:20 UTC – Centering Fix

Question Asked:
"it is not centered gang"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the founders text width from `width: 100%` to `width: fit-content` to allow the `margin: 0 auto` to properly center the text. The fit-content width makes the element only as wide as the text content, enabling proper centering.

Additional Context:
The previous `width: 100%` prevented the `margin: 0 auto` from working effectively. The `fit-content` width allows the element to size to its content, making the auto margins work correctly for centering.

## 2025-01-27 17:25 UTC – Centering Method Change

Question Asked:
"it still isnt centered my g"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the founders text centering method from `margin: 0 auto` with `fit-content` width to absolute positioning with `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`. This is a more reliable method for centering absolutely positioned elements.

Additional Context:
The previous margin-based centering wasn't working effectively. The absolute positioning approach moves the element to 50% from the left and then shifts it back by 50% of its own width using transform, ensuring perfect centering.

## 2025-01-27 17:30 UTC – Mobile Responsiveness

Question Asked:
"banggg. now we need it mobile rendered too"

Response / Action Taken:
Added `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)` to the mobile founders text CSS to ensure the "Created By" text is properly centered on mobile devices using the same absolute positioning method as desktop.

Additional Context:
The founders text was successfully centered on desktop using absolute positioning. The mobile version now uses the same centering approach to ensure consistent layout across all device sizes.

## 2025-01-27 17:35 UTC – Mobile Text Adjustment

Question Asked:
"it starts cutting off names when viewing on mobile"

Response / Action Taken:
Reduced the mobile font size for the founders text from `0.8rem` to `0.6rem` to provide more space for all founder names to fit on mobile screens without being cut off.

Additional Context:
The "Created By" text with all founder names was being cut off on mobile devices due to insufficient space. The smaller font size ensures all names remain visible while maintaining the single-line layout.

## 2025-01-27 17:40 UTC – Mobile Plane Centering Fix

Question Asked:
"on mlbile the plane is getting pushed down. it should always remain centered"

Response / Action Taken:
Removed `margin-top: 15vh` from the mobile `.content-plane-container` CSS to prevent the plane from being pushed down on mobile devices. The plane should now remain centered on mobile as it does on desktop.

Additional Context:
The margin-top was pushing the entire container (including the plane) down on mobile devices, causing the plane to lose its centered position. Removing this margin allows the plane to maintain its centered position across all device sizes.

## 2025-01-27 17:45 UTC – Plane Centering Fix

Question Asked:
"can you verify? it looks lower than it should"

Response / Action Taken:
Removed `padding-top: 10vh` from the `.ascii-container` CSS. This padding was pushing the plane down by 10% of the viewport height, making it appear lower than its true center. Now the plane should be properly centered based on its middle line.

Additional Context:
The plane was appearing lower than expected due to the padding-top that was offsetting the flexbox centering. With the padding removed, the plane should now be truly centered vertically within the container.

## 2025-01-27 17:50 UTC – Balanced Plane Positioning

Question Asked:
"now it looks high. lets meet in the middle at 5vh?"

Response / Action Taken:
Added `padding-top: 5vh` to the `.ascii-container` to position the plane at a balanced height - not too high and not too low. This provides a nice middle ground for the plane positioning.

Additional Context:
After removing the 10vh padding that made the plane too low, the plane appeared too high. The 5vh padding provides the perfect balance for optimal visual positioning.

## 2025-01-27 17:55 UTC – Mobile Text Positioning

Question Asked:
"ok that looks better. now for the mobile rendered version, the erebor text, about and created by need to be pushed down."

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the mobile content positioning from `bottom: -70%` to `bottom: -50%` to push the text content (Erebor title, about, and created by) down closer to the plane on mobile devices for better visibility and positioning.

Additional Context:
The mobile text content was positioned too far below the plane. The adjustment brings it closer to the plane while maintaining proper spacing and readability on mobile devices.

## 2025-01-27 18:00 UTC – Mobile Text Wrapping

Question Asked:
"ok for the mobile rendered created by, i dont want the text to get smaller. it can go to a 2nd or 34d line as needed"

Response / Action Taken:
Removed `white-space: nowrap` from mobile founders text to allow wrapping to multiple lines (2nd, 3rd, etc.) as needed, and increased font size from `0.6rem` back to `0.8rem` for better readability on mobile devices.

Additional Context:
The mobile founders text was previously forced to stay on one line with a smaller font size to prevent cutoff. Now it can wrap naturally to multiple lines with normal font size for better readability.

## 2025-01-27 18:05 UTC – Mobile Text Cutoff Fix

Question Asked:
"didnt work"

Response / Action Taken:
Limited the mobile content container width to `95vw` and centered it with `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`. Adjusted the founders text to use `max-width: 100%` and `margin: 0` to fit within the content container and prevent cutoff on the sides.

Additional Context:
The previous static positioning approach didn't work because the founders text is inside the absolutely positioned content container. The new approach limits the container width and ensures the text fits properly within it.

## 2025-01-27 18:10 UTC – Natural Text Wrapping

Question Asked:
"Now its cut off on the left side of the screen. just let the words wrap centered underneath as the screen gets smaller"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed mobile content positioning from absolute to relative with `position: relative`, `width: 100%`, `left: 0`, and `transform: none`. Added `white-space: normal` to founders text to allow natural wrapping and centering underneath as the screen gets smaller.

Additional Context:
The absolute positioning was causing cutoff issues. The relative positioning allows the text to wrap naturally and center underneath the plane as the screen size decreases, providing better mobile responsiveness.

## 2025-01-27 18:15 UTC – Consistent Text Wrapping

Question Asked:
"increase the width to the same width as the about section so it wraps similarly"

Response / Action Taken:
Set the mobile founders text `max-width` to `350px` (same as the about section) and added `margin: 0 auto` to center it. This ensures both the about section and founders text wrap similarly on mobile devices.

Additional Context:
The founders text now has the same width constraints as the about section, providing consistent text wrapping behavior and visual alignment across both text elements on mobile devices.

## 2025-01-27 18:20 UTC – Founders Text Positioning Fix

Question Asked:
"its still not the same gang"

Response / Action Taken:
Removed absolute positioning (`position: absolute`, `left: 50%`, `transform: translateX(-50%)`) from the founders text on desktop to match the about section behavior. Both sections now have the same `max-width: 350px` on mobile and are part of the normal content flow.

Additional Context:
The founders text was still using absolute positioning on desktop which was affecting its behavior. Now both the about and founders sections behave identically with the same width constraints and content flow.

## 2025-01-27 18:25 UTC – Desktop Centering Fix

Question Asked:
"ok now that we did that, on the desktop version it isnt centered."

Response / Action Taken:
Added `margin: 0 auto` and `width: fit-content` to the desktop founders text to center it horizontally while maintaining the single-line display with `white-space: nowrap`.

Additional Context:
After removing the absolute positioning to match mobile behavior, the desktop founders text lost its centering. The new approach centers it using margin auto and fit-content width, providing centered single-line text on desktop while allowing natural wrapping on mobile.

## 2025-01-27 18:30 UTC – Founders Text Structural Fix

Question Asked:
"didnt work gang"

Response / Action Taken:
Moved the founders text outside the content div to be a direct child of the content-plane-container. Added absolute positioning for desktop with `bottom: -25%`, `left: 50%`, and `transform: translateX(-50%)`. Added mobile overrides to use static positioning and natural wrapping.

Additional Context:
The founders text was inside the absolutely positioned content div which was preventing proper centering. Moving it outside and positioning it independently allows for proper centering on desktop while maintaining mobile responsiveness.

## 2025-01-27 18:35 UTC – Founders Text Positioning Adjustment

Question Asked:
"ok that worked. but now its above the title and about section"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the founders text bottom positioning from `-25%` to `-120%` to move it below the title and about section instead of above them.

Additional Context:
The founders text was appearing above the title and about section due to insufficient negative bottom positioning. The increased negative value moves it much lower, positioning it below the other content elements.

## 2025-01-27 18:40 UTC – Founders Text Spacing Adjustment

Question Asked:
"its too far underneath the about section now"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the founders text bottom positioning from `-120%` to `-80%` to bring it closer to the about section while maintaining proper spacing below the title and about text.

Additional Context:
The founders text was positioned too far below the about section. The reduced negative bottom value provides better spacing while keeping the text below the other content elements.

## 2025-01-27 18:45 UTC – Mobile Content Positioning

Question Asked:
"perfect, now on mobile we need to push all down a slightly"

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the mobile content positioning from `bottom: -80%` to `bottom: -90%` to push all content (title, about, and founders) down slightly on mobile devices for better spacing.

Additional Context:
The mobile content needed to be positioned lower to provide better visual balance and spacing on smaller screens. The increased negative bottom value moves all text content down slightly.

## 2025-01-27 15:45 UTC – Mobile Spacing Reference

Question Asked:
User needed to see the mobile spacing section in erebor.html for adjustments.

Response / Action Taken:
Provided the complete mobile media query section (lines 110-160) showing all mobile spacing controls including content positioning, container margins, text widths, and font sizes. Highlighted key adjustable properties like bottom positioning, margins, and max-widths.

Additional Context:
User is working on fine-tuning mobile layout for the Erebor page, specifically looking for spacing controls in the CSS media query section.

## 2025-01-27 15:47 UTC – Founders Vertical Spacing & Syntax Fix

Question Asked:
User moved title and about lower on mobile and needed to know where to adjust vertical spacing of the founders section.

Response / Action Taken:
Fixed a missing semicolon in the mobile CSS (.content { bottom: -150%; }). Provided options for adjusting founders vertical spacing on mobile: 1) Add margin-top/margin-bottom, 2) Change to absolute positioning with bottom percentage, 3) Add padding to container. Explained current mobile founders uses static positioning for natural flow.

Additional Context:
User is fine-tuning mobile layout spacing after adjusting title and about positioning. The founders section currently uses static positioning on mobile for natural document flow.

## 2025-01-27 15:50 UTC – Mobile Content Positioning Adjustment

Question Asked:
User needed all written content moved lower by 15% on mobile only.

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the mobile .content bottom positioning from 50% to 35% (a 15% reduction) within the mobile media query. This only affects screens 600px and smaller, keeping desktop layout unchanged.

Additional Context:
User confirmed this should only affect mobile devices. Desktop version maintains original -70% positioning while mobile now uses 35% positioning for lower content placement.

## 2025-01-27 15:52 UTC – Mobile Positioning Fix

Question Asked:
User reported that the content didn't move at all after the 15% adjustment.

Response / Action Taken:
Discovered the issue - mobile .content was using position: relative instead of position: absolute, which prevented bottom positioning from working. Changed mobile .content to position: absolute with bottom: -85% (15% lower than original -70%) and restored proper left/transform positioning.

Additional Context:
The mobile media query was overriding the absolute positioning with relative positioning, which made the bottom property ineffective. Fixed by restoring absolute positioning for proper mobile content placement.

## 2025-01-27 15:54 UTC – Founders Positioning Fix

Question Asked:
User reported that the "From" text was appearing above the title and about section after the mobile positioning fix.

Response / Action Taken:
Changed mobile .founders from position: static to position: absolute with bottom: -95% (10% lower than content at -85%) and restored left/transform positioning. This ensures the founders text appears below the title and about section.

Additional Context:
The founders text was using static positioning which caused it to appear above other content. Fixed by using absolute positioning to properly layer it below the main content.

## 2025-01-27 15:56 UTC – Founders Spacing Adjustment

Question Asked:
User reported that the founders text was overlaying the about content after the positioning fix.

Response / Action Taken:
Increased the bottom positioning from -95% to -110% to create more space between the about content and founders text, preventing overlap.

Additional Context:
The founders text was too close to the about section, causing visual overlap. Increased spacing by 15% to provide better visual separation.

## 2025-01-27 15:58 UTC – Founders Text Width Adjustment

Question Asked:
User wanted to reformat the founders text to be wider, but only on mobile.

Response / Action Taken:
Increased the max-width of the mobile .founders from 350px to 450px to make the founders text wider on mobile devices while keeping desktop unchanged.

Additional Context:
User had previously adjusted the mobile content positioning (bottom: -100%) and founders positioning (bottom: -160%) and now needed the founders text to be wider for better mobile layout.

## 2025-01-27 16:00 UTC – Founders Width Fix

Question Asked:
User reported that increasing max-width to 450px didn't make the founders text wider on mobile.

Response / Action Taken:
Added width: auto to the mobile .founders to override the desktop width: fit-content setting that was preventing the text from using the full max-width. This allows the founders text to expand to the full 450px width on mobile.

Additional Context:
The desktop .founders had width: fit-content which was overriding the mobile max-width setting. Adding width: auto in the mobile media query fixes this issue.

## 2025-01-27 16:02 UTC – Stronger Mobile Founders Width Override

Question Asked:
User reported that the previous width changes didn't work and wanted to ensure desktop version wasn't affected.

Response / Action Taken:
Increased mobile .founders max-width to 600px, changed width to 100%, and added !important to white-space: normal to ensure it overrides desktop nowrap setting. This should make the founders text much wider on mobile while keeping desktop unchanged.

Additional Context:
The desktop .founders has white-space: nowrap which was preventing the mobile width changes from taking effect. Using !important ensures the mobile override works properly.

## 2025-01-27 16:04 UTC – Founders Positioning Fix

Question Asked:
User reported that the "From" text was appearing above the title and about section after adjusting the bottom positioning to -1%.

Response / Action Taken:
Changed the mobile .founders bottom positioning back from -1% to -160% to place the founders text below the title and about section while keeping the user's width adjustments (130% width, 600px max-width).

Additional Context:
The user had adjusted the width to 130% and max-width to 600px but accidentally changed bottom positioning to -1%, which moved the text above other content. Fixed by restoring proper bottom positioning.

## 2025-01-27 16:06 UTC – About Section Width Adjustment

Question Asked:
User wanted to make the width of the about section match the founders text width on mobile.

Response / Action Taken:
Changed mobile .about max-width from 350px to 600px and added width: 130% to match the founders text settings (max-width: 600px, width: 130%).

Additional Context:
User had previously adjusted founders text to be wider (130% width, 600px max-width) and now wanted consistent width for the about section on mobile.

## 2025-01-27 16:06 UTC – Mobile Text Centering Fix

Question Asked:
User wanted about section width to match founders text width, then reported it was off center after the change.

Response / Action Taken:
Added margin-left: -15% to both mobile .about and .founders to compensate for the 130% width and center them properly. This shifts them left by 15% to offset the extra 30% width.

Additional Context:
When width is set to 130%, elements become wider than their container, causing them to appear off-center. The negative margin compensates for this extra width.

## 2025-01-27 16:08 UTC – Founders Centering Fix

Question Asked:
User reported that the founders text was still off to the left after the centering fix.

Response / Action Taken:
Removed margin-left: -15% from mobile .founders and changed left positioning from 50% to 35% to properly center the wider text. The absolute positioning with transform needed different centering approach than the about section.

Additional Context:
The founders text uses absolute positioning with transform, which requires adjusting the left percentage rather than using negative margins for proper centering with wider width.

## 2025-01-27 16:10 UTC – Further Founders Centering Adjustment

Question Asked:
User reported founders text was still to the left after the previous centering fix.

Response / Action Taken:
Changed mobile .founders left positioning from 35% to 25% to try to center the wider text better. The absolute positioning with transform and wider width requires fine-tuning the left percentage.

Additional Context:
The 130% width combined with absolute positioning and transform makes centering tricky. Adjusting left percentage to compensate for the extra width.

## 2025-01-27 16:12 UTC – Successful Founders Centering

Question Asked:
User reported that the founders text centering was now working after adjusting the left positioning back to 50%.

Response / Action Taken:
Confirmed that the mobile .founders centering is now working with left: 50% and transform: translateX(-50%). Both about section and founders text now have consistent 130% width and 600px max-width with proper centering.

Additional Context:
The user found the correct positioning by reverting to left: 50% with transform, which works properly with the absolute positioning and wider width settings.

## 2025-01-27 16:14 UTC – Back Button Addition

Question Asked:
User wanted a back button at the top left of the erebor.html page to navigate back to home.

Response / Action Taken:
Added a back button with fixed positioning to top-left corner (20px from edges), styled with semi-transparent background and border to match site aesthetic. Button links to index.html and includes hover effects. High z-index ensures it stays on top of other content.

Additional Context:
The back button provides easy navigation from the Erebor page back to the main Hangar 24 page, improving user experience and site navigation.

## 2025-01-27 16:16 UTC – Back Button Simplification

Question Asked:
User wanted the back button to just be the word "Back" without any CSS styling.

Response / Action Taken:
Removed all CSS styling for .back-button class and simplified the HTML to just be a basic link with "Back" text, removing the arrow and all custom styling.

Additional Context:
The back button is now a simple, unstyled link that will use default browser styling, providing minimal visual interference while maintaining navigation functionality.

## 2025-01-27 16:18 UTC – Back Link Styling

Question Asked:
User wanted padding on the back link and the same formatting as the "about" section.

Response / Action Taken:
Added .back-link CSS class with same font family, size, color, and letter spacing as the about section, plus 10px padding and fixed positioning to top-left corner. Added hover effect for better UX.

Additional Context:
The back link now matches the about section's typography while maintaining proper positioning and padding for better usability.

## 2025-01-27 16:20 UTC – Production Deployment Status

Question Asked:
User wanted to push index and erebor to production.

Response / Action Taken:
Checked git status and confirmed that both index.html and erebor.html are already up to date with production. The latest changes including the back button and mobile layout improvements are already deployed.

Additional Context:
The production site is current with all recent changes. No additional deployment needed as files are already synchronized with the remote repository.

## 2025-01-27 16:22 UTC – Back Button Visibility Fix

Question Asked:
User reported they couldn't see the back button on production, then said it was removed.

Response / Action Taken:
Confirmed the back link HTML and CSS were still present. Made the back button more visible by increasing z-index to 10000, making text fully opaque, adding darker background, and adding a white border. The button was not removed but may have been hard to see.

Additional Context:
The back button was present in the HTML but may have been difficult to see due to styling. Enhanced visibility with higher z-index, opaque text, darker background, and border.

## 2025-01-27 16:24 UTC – Back Link Styling Simplification

Question Asked:
User wanted to remove the background box and make the back link use the same CSS as the about section.

Response / Action Taken:
Removed background, border, and border-radius from .back-link. Updated styling to match about section: same font family, size, color (rgba(255,255,255,0.8)), and letter spacing (0.02em). Kept high z-index for visibility.

Additional Context:
The back link now has clean, minimal styling that matches the about section's typography without any visual box or border elements.

## 2025-01-27 15:45 UTC – Bug Fix

Question Asked:
User reported that the LOMBARD clickable positioning was messed up after previous changes.

Response / Action Taken:
Fixed the LOMBARD clickable positioning by correcting the character position calculation. Changed from position 42 to position 40 in the JavaScript code that makes LOMBARD clickable. The issue was that the character count was off by 2 positions, causing the clickable area to target the wrong part of the ASCII art.

Additional Context:
This was a follow-up to the previous session where we made LOMBARD clickable. The positioning calculation needed to be more precise to target the exact "LOMBARD" text in the ASCII art plane.

## 2025-01-27 15:50 UTC – HTML Rendering Fix

Question Asked:
User reported that HTML code was being displayed as text in the ASCII art plane instead of being rendered as clickable links.

Response / Action Taken:
Fixed the HTML rendering issue by removing `white-space: pre` from the CSS and adding `.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')` to convert newlines to HTML line breaks. The `white-space: pre` was causing the HTML to be treated as literal text instead of being processed as HTML elements.

Additional Context:
This was a follow-up to the LOMBARD positioning fix. The issue was that the CSS was preserving whitespace and treating HTML as literal text, which prevented the clickable links from rendering properly.
