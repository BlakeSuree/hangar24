## 2025-01-27 [Current Time] – Wave-like Hover Effect Implementation

Question Asked:
User wanted the hover effect on the Spitfire art plane to create a wave-like effect that diminishes with distance from the cursor, rather than having the same effect for every character.

Response / Action Taken:
- Replaced uniform glow effect with distance-based wave effect
- Created 4 different glow classes (glow, glow-1, glow-2, glow-3) with diminishing intensity
- Updated JavaScript to calculate distance from cursor and apply appropriate glow class
- Set maximum distance of 8 pixels for the wave effect
- Each glow level has different opacity, scale, and text-shadow values

Additional Context:
- Wave effect creates a more natural, organic hover interaction
- Closest characters get strongest glow (glow class)
- Farther characters get progressively weaker effects (glow-1, glow-2, glow-3)
- Effect creates a ripple-like visual response to mouse movement
- Maintains smooth transitions and responsive feel

## 2025-01-27 [Current Time] – Compression Effect Implementation

Question Asked:
User found the wave-like hover effect unsatisfactory and wanted to replace it with a compression effect where sections compress when hovering over them.

Response / Action Taken:
- Removed all wave-like glow effects and related CSS classes
- Implemented simple compression effect using scale(0.85) transform
- Updated JavaScript to apply compression to characters within 12px of cursor
- Added smooth transition with ease-out timing for natural feel
- Simplified the interaction to focus on compression rather than glow

Additional Context:
- Compression effect creates a "pressing down" visual feedback
- Characters scale down to 85% when hovered
- Effect radius set to 12 pixels for good coverage
- Smooth 0.15s transition provides responsive feel
- Much simpler and more direct interaction than previous wave effect
